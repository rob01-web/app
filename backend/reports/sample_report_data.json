  "executive_summary": "Well-located, turnkey 12-unit multifamily in Toronto\u2019s Bloor West/Etobicoke corridor offering immediate, stable cash flow and minimal near-term CapEx. At the CAD 4.85M ask, in-place NOI of CAD 190,276 implies a 3.92% cap, squarely within current Toronto multifamily ranges (3.5\u20134.5%) and supported by sub-2% area vacancy and a professional tenant base.\n\nPricing screens attractively on a per-square-foot basis (~CAD 386/sf) versus comparable sales at CAD 400\u2013420/sf, aided by 2020\u20132021 capital upgrades (roof, windows, HVAC, common areas). The 0.42-acre site with 16 parking stalls, in-suite laundry, and larger unit sizes (~1,050 sf avg) enhances tenant retention and long-term durability of income.\n\nPrimary risks are Ontario rent control (built pre-2018) limiting annual increases, potential property tax reassessment post-sale, and debt service coverage sensitivity at today\u2019s rates without CMHC-insured financing or additional equity. Modest operational optimization (parking/storage monetization, RUBS for water where permissible) can lift NOI and push cap rate >4.1% at a negotiated price. Overall, the asset\u2019s location, condition, and income stability warrant a strong bid.\n",
  "property_overview": {
    "description": "2845 Bloor Street West is a 12,600 sf, 12-unit apartment asset built in 1995 and comprehensively refreshed in 2020\u20132021 (new roof, energy-efficient windows, upgraded central HVAC, renovated common areas). The property offers a balanced unit mix (10 two-bedroom units and 2 three-bedroom units), all with in-suite laundry, secured entry, and video intercom. The site spans 0.42 acres with 16 parking spaces and dedicated storage for each unit, supporting additional ancillary income.\n\nSituated near Bloor West Village and walking distance to the Bloor-Danforth subway line, the property benefits from strong neighborhood fundamentals: low crime, high household incomes (~CAD 95k), 8% five-year population growth, and a 1.8% rental vacancy rate. With limited new supply and sustained immigration-driven demand, tenancy risk is low and turnover provides mark-to-market opportunities despite provincial rent control.\n",
    "key_highlights": [
      "Prime Bloor West/Etobicoke location with subway access and strong neighborhood amenities",
      "Turnkey asset with recent capital upgrades (roof 2021, windows 2020, HVAC 2021, refreshed commons)",
      "Attractive pricing at ~CAD 386/sf vs. comps at CAD 400\u2013420/sf",
      "Stabilized occupancy (100%) and professional tenant profile",
      "In-suite laundry across all units enhancing retention and rentability",
      "16 parking spaces (excess over unit count) and storage lockers for ancillary income",
      "Larger average unit sizes (~1,050 sf) suitable for families and downsizers",
      "Market cap rate alignment (3.92% at ask within 3.5\u20134.5% range)"
    ],
    "concerns": [
      "Ontario rent control (pre-2018 build) limits annual increases to guideline except on turnover",
      "Potential property tax reassessment post-transaction could compress NOI",
      "Debt service coverage may be tight at market interest rates without CMHC or lower LTV",
      "Rising utilities and maintenance cost inflation could pressure expense ratio (~45%)",
      "R3 zoning may constrain near-term densification/redevelopment without a rezoning process"

    "detailed_analysis": "At the CAD 4.85M ask, price metrics are compelling: ~CAD 386/sf (12,600 sf) and ~CAD 404k/door. With in-place AGI of CAD 345,600 and reported expenses of CAD 155,324, NOI is CAD 190,276, yielding a going-in cap of ~3.92% and GRM of ~14.0x. The expense ratio (~45%) is reasonable for Toronto given owner-paid water/sewer and common area utilities; NOI per unit is ~CAD 15,856. Given area vacancy of 1.8%, a stabilized pro forma with a modest vacancy/credit loss still supports durable cash flow.\n\nUpside levers include ancillary revenue: monetizing four surplus parking stalls at ~CAD 150/month and 12 storage lockers at ~CAD 30/month could add ~CAD 11.5k/year, lifting NOI to ~CAD 201.8k and pushing the cap above ~4.16% at ask and ~4.34% near a negotiated CAD 4.65M. Rent growth is guideline-limited (2\u20132.5% typical), but turnover enables vacancy decontrol to align to market. Financing sensitivity is material: at prevailing rates, 50\u201355% LTV conventional debt is likely needed for a 1.15x+ DSCR unless CMHC-insured financing (lower rates/longer amortization) is utilized. Overall, price sits below psf comps while delivering a market-aligned cap with clear, low-risk operational upside.\n"
